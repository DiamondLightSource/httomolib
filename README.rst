HTTomolib is a library of methods for tomography
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**HTTomolib** is a collection of image processing methods in Python for computed tomography.

**HTTomolib** can be used as a stand-alone library, however it has been specifically developed to 
work together with the `HTTomo <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/httomo/>`_ package.
HTTomo is a user interface (UI) written in Python for fast big data processing using MPI protocols.
